Requirement:
        - Linux system
        - Perl 5.8 or higher
        - BioPerl installed
        - Perl modeules installed
          (see "The SINE_Scan (version 1.01) Tutorial" for the full list
          of modules used)
        - Blast+ program installed
        - Python porgram installed
	- SINE-FINDER.py installed
        - MUSCLE program installed
        - EMBOSS program installed
        - CD-HIT program installed
	- Bedtools program installed
	
How to use:
1. Read "The SINE_Scan (version 1.01) Tutorial" (attached in the package)

2. Prepare sequences:
        - Genomic sequences must in FASTA format, with suffix being 
          'fasta', 'fa' or 'fas'.

3. Install program:
        - Download SINE_Scan-v1.01.tar.gz
        - Untar SINE_Scan-v1.01.tar.gz and copy the package of 
          "SINE_Scan-v1.01" to a folder.
        - Type "perl SINE_Scan_Installer.pl", and provide pathes for
          reqired programs according to instructions.
	- we will patch 'SINE-FINDER.py' by new characters in 'SINE_FINDER.patch' to enhance SINE-FINDER.py.

4. Run program:
        - Type "perl SINE_Scan_process.pl", and provide parameters accroding to 
          the instructions
        
5. Examples:
        - For automatic genome-wide SINE annotation, type:
          perl SINE_Scan_process.pl -s 123 -g Rice.fasta -o Osat -d tmp -z tmp
          
        - For verification of SINE candidates, type:
          perl SINE_Scan_process.pl -s 2 -i sine.fasta -g Rice.fasta -o Osat -d tmp -z tmp
